# YouTube Downloader

This project is a **YouTube Downloader** application built using **Flask** for the backend and **React Vite** with **Tailwind CSS** for the frontend. The goal of this project is to provide a safe, efficient way for users to download YouTube videos without intrusive ads that are often encountered on other downloaders.

## Features
- **Download Videos**: Download videos from YouTube in various resolutions (e.g., 1080p, 720p).
- **User-friendly Interface**: Built with React Vite and styled using Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive UI.
- **Flask Backend**: The backend handles the video processing and downloading requests.
- **Fast and Reliable**: Avoids unwanted ads and provides a straightforward download process.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into the following main parts:



### Frontend (`client/`)
- **React**: The client-side of the app is built using React for dynamic interaction.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for responsive design.

### Backend (`backend/app.py`)
- **Flask**: Flask is used to handle HTTP requests from the frontend and manage video downloads.

### Python Environment (`env`)
- The Python environment contains dependencies for the Flask application, such as `Flask`, `yt-dlp`, and others.
